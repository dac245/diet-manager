Application does not have the ability to properly update the chart on the Overview Tab.
Application does not have the ability to display Food items or Exercises added to a Day in the log (it can, however, still add them to the internal data structure and use them for calculations in the Overview tab).
Application can only handle one Day in the Overview tab (having multiple Days created results in none being displayed in the JComboBox in the Overview tab).

Food tab and Exercise tab are fully functional.
